Project duration =2.5years

Manual testing cost: 10 man-hour per week * 2.5 years * 52 weeks = 1300 man-hours
Automated tests development cost: 35 man-hours setup framework + 15 man-hours per week scenario development * 0.5 years * 52 = 425 man-hours
Automated test execution & result analyzis: 2 man-hours per week * 2.5 years * 52 = 260 man-hours

ROI = (1300-(425+260))/(425+260)= 89.7%
